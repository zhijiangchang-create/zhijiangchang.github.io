As a small celebration (and maybe a little reward for myself too 😄), we’re extending our vacation to enjoy the moment together. Well deserved after the hard work!

That was a tough Science paper this year — but both of them achieved the highest level. Super proud moment as a parent. 💪✨

Along the way, I built an Agentic AI Science Teaching Assistant to support their preparation — powered by Pinecone as the vector database and carefully structured prompts aligned closely with the MOE curriculum. The goal wasn’t just to generate answers, but to guide thinking, reinforce concepts, and provide explainable feedback.

This experience reinforced something I strongly believe: AI-native solutions are not just transforming enterprise B2B systems. They’re quietly reshaping the B2C software we use every day — including how our children learn.

The future isn’t just AI-enabled. It’s AI-native.
