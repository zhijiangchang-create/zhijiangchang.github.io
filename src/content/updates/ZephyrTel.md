I wrapped up my time at ZephyrTel.

During my time there, I focused heavily on business-goal–driven software design and operations — making sure what we built directly supported measurable outcomes. I also put strong emphasis on process-based O&M to reduce risks and keep operational costs under control.
That said, the industry was clearly shifting toward AI-native innovation and state-of-the-art intelligent systems. As someone deeply passionate about AI, I felt it was the right time to move on and pursue opportunities where I could work more directly on cutting-edge AI development.
Grateful for the experience, and excited for what’s next.
