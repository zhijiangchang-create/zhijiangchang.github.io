In one experiment, I provided a structured requirement spec and technical spec, and within about 20 minutes it generated a simple web application with a backend database wired up end-to-end. It also produced technical documentation in Markdown format and outlined deployment steps for both local and cloud environments.

That said, the generated code still carries notable security and architectural concerns — input validation, authentication, dependency hygiene, and threat modeling absolutely require human review. But the productivity gains are no longer theoretical.

We’re not at “replace engineers.”
We’re clearly at “amplify engineers.” And that shift is happening fast.
