Acquisition of ViSenze: https://www.linkedin.com/company/visenze/posts/?feedView=all
An incredible milestone! it has truly been an honour to build, lead, and, most importantly, grow together with such a talented team.

Following the acquisition of ViSenze, I’ve decided it’s the right moment to close this chapter. It has truly been an honour to build, lead, and grow alongside such an exceptional team. Watching the company scale, evolve, and reach this milestone is something I’ll always be proud of.

The AI landscape over the past four years has transformed in ways I could hardly have imagined — from large-scale foundation model training, to fine-tuning, to RAG architectures, and now to fully AI-native, agentic system design. Being part of this wave has been both intense and inspiring.

For now, I’m taking a short break to slow down and spend time with my kids. They’ve just crossed an important milestone themselves — completing their PSLE and stepping into the next stage of life. It feels like the perfect time to pause, recharge, and celebrate together.

Excited for what’s ahead — but first, family time.
